1.1 Collaborating with a team of five members, I contributed to a project that involved comprehensive data cleaning, including handling null values
 and outliers.
1.2 Additionally, I utilized data visualization techniques to deliver meaningful insights from the dataset. I also performed text preprocessing tasks 
 such as lemmatization, stemming, and tokenization to enhance the quality of textual data.
1.3 Furthermore, I applied embedding techniques such as Bag-of-Words (BOW), TF-IDF, and Word2Vec to capture semantic relationships in the text.
1.4 My major focus was on model training, implementing model tracking using MLFlow, and orchestrating the workflow to ensure efficient and
 effective execution of the project.
